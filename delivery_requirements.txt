Initially Mentioned Strategy :

Id like to know if you can create a trading bot that fetches information from a list of 30 cryptocurrencies stored in an Excel file 
and automatically makes purchases at market value on Binance. 
After each purchase, the bot checks for the highest purchase value of each cryptocurrency 
and creates a limit sell order with a percentage higher than the highest purchase value. 

I would like the main program to have a graphical interface that allows me to 
 - choose the amount in USDT for the purchase, 
 - the percentage increase for the sale, 

and to be able to perform cycles, such as repeating the purchase cycle with the trading bot every X minutes, 
and I would like to be able to choose that time as well. 
I also wanted the main program to call the bot as a function because it had to call a function first, 
which already exists with the strategy to create the list in Excel. 
The logic is that the main program repeats the cycle every X amount of time, and when the cycle is initiated, 
it first calls a function to create the list (this function already exists), 
and then calls the function of the trading bot to perform the purchases and sales. 

Scheme mentioned Latest :

Scheme:
- First cycle:
- Call the function to create the list in Excel.
- Import the list of assets to trade from the Excel file into variable 1.
- Wait for 5 minutes. (time entered in the GUI)
- Call the function to create the list in Excel.
- Import the list of assets to trade from the Excel file into variable 2.
- Wait for 5 minutes. (time entered in the GUI)
- Call the function to create the list in Excel.
- Import the list of assets to trade from the Excel file into variable 3.
- Wait for 5 minutes. (time entered in the GUI)
- Enter the loop:
- Call the function to create the list in Excel.
- Check the balance in USDT in the Binance account.
- Check the balance in BNB in the Binance account. (fees are paid in BNB)
- If less than 40 USDT in BNB, buy 20 USDT of BNB (ensures a minimum balance of 40 USDT in BNB for fee payment)
- Check and update the balance in USDT in the Binance account.
- Use the list of coins in variable 1 to buy
- Calculate the maximum number of transactions based on the available balance and the USDT value to be invested per coin.
- Set the number of transactions (maximum of 30 or the maximum number allowed by the available balance at the time).
- For each asset purchase:
- Check if its not on the list of assets to avoid.
- Check indicators, if not move on to the next asset.
- Execute a market value purchase transaction.
- Check the highest purchase value of the asset made in this purchase in the transaction history.
- Create a limit sell order with a percentage, higher than the highest purchase value, defined in the user interface.
- Move on to the next asset.
- Save the content of variable 2 into variable 1.
- Save the content of variable 3 into variable 2.
- Import the list of assets to trade from the Excel file into variable 3.
- Wait for 5 minutes (time entered in the GUI).
- Restart the loop.


1. Graphical User Interface (GUI):
   - User settings:
     - Value in USDT for purchase.
     - Percentage increase for sale.
     - Time interval to repeat the trading cycle.
     - Type of cycles:
       - Single cycle
       - Repeat "x" times
         - Number of repetitions.
       - Continuous
     - Idle Time between end of one cycle and start of next cycle in minutes.
     - List of assets to avoid purchasing.
     - Countdown timer showing the time remaining until the next cycle.
     - Introduction of APIs.
     - Comment log with errors, cycle numbers, etc.
     - Log of coin purchases with date and purchase values, and creation of sell orders with values.
     - Introduction of the path to the Excel file where the list of assets to be purchased will be imported.

2. Function to Create List in Excel: (Already Exists)
   - Receives the list of 30 assets.
   - Saves this list in an Excel file.

3. Trading Bot:
   - Checks the balance in USDT in the Binance account.
   - Calculates the maximum number of transactions based on the available balance and the USDT value to be invested per asset.
   - Sets the number of transactions (maximum of 30 or the maximum number allowed by the available balance at the moment).
   - Imports the list of assets to be traded from the Excel file.
   - For each asset purchase:
     - Check if it is not in the list of assets to avoid.
     - Check two types of indicators.
     - Executes a market value purchase transaction.
     - Checks the highest purchase value of the asset made in this purchase in the transaction history.
     - Creates a limit sell order with a percentage, higher than the highest purchase value, defined in the user interface.
     - Moves on to the next asset.

4. Main Program:
   - Starts the trading cycle at each specified time interval.
   - Calls the function to create the list in Excel.
   - Calls the trading bot to execute purchases and sales.
